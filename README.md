## MTA-STS from Kubernetes

This is a very simple set of YAML files to implement the
[MTA-STS](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8461.txt) /.well-known/mta-sts.txt
serving with Let's Encrypt certificate (assumes you have installed
[cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager)) already).

Change the config.yaml service to suit your needs.
